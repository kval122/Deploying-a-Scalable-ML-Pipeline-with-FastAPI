# Model Card
This model card provides a description of the Census Income Predicition Model.
For additional information see the Model Card paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf

## Model Details
Model Type: Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn
Version: 1.0
Primary Purpose: Predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually based on demographic and employment features.

## Intended Use
Predicting income levels (<=50K or >50K) for research, policy, and educational purposes.

## Training Data
The model was trained on the Census Income Dataset, a publicly available dataset containing demographic and employment information for adults in the United States.

Number of Samples: 32,561
Features Used:
Categorical: workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country.
Numerical: age, hours-per-week, education-num, etc.
The target variable is the income class: <=50K or >50K.

## Evaluation Data
The test dataset was a 20% split from the original dataset.
Preprocessing: Categorical variables encoded using one-hot encoding; labels binarized.

## Metrics
_Please include the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics._
Precision: 0.7381
Recall: 0.6245
F1-Score: 0.6766

## Ethical Considerations
Bias: The model's predictions may reflect biases present in the dataset, such as socioeconomic, racial, or gender biases.
Fairness: Care must be taken to ensure the model does not unfairly disadvantage any group.
Transparency: Users should understand the limitations of the model and avoid using it for high-stakes decisions without additional analysis.


## Caveats and Recommendations
Limitations: Model performance may degrade on populations not represented in the training data.

Recommendations:
Consider fairness-aware training methods to reduce biases in predictions.
Use interpretability tools to understand and explain predictions.
Regularly monitor model performance.
